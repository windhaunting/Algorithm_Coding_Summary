Topological sorting  for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for
 every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is 
 not possible if the graph is not a DAG. Therefore, it could be also used to check whether there is a cycle in a graph.


## Ways to implement topological sorting. 

 #### 1) use recursive way:  use stack


```
    # In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We don’t print the vertex immediately,
    # we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices,
    # then push it to a stack. Finally, print contents of stack. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack
    # only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack.

    # Python program to print topological sorting of a DAG
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Class to represent a graph
    class Graph:
        def __init__(self):
            self.graph = defaultdict(list) # dictionary containing adjacency List
            self.vertices = set() # vertices
    
        # function to add an edge to graph
        def addEdge(self,u,v):
            self.graph[u].append(v)
            if u not in self.vertices:
                self.vertices.add(u)
            if v not in self.vertices:
                self.vertices.add(v)
                
        # A recursive function used by topologicalSort
        def topologicalSortHelper(self,v, visited, stack):
    
            # Mark the current node as visited.
            visited.add(v)
    
            # Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this vertex
            for i in self.graph[v]:
                if i not in visited:
                    self.topologicalSortHelper(i,visited,stack)
    
            # Push current vertex to stack which stores the result
            stack.append(v)
    
        # The function to do Topological Sort. It uses recursive 
        # topologicalSortUtil()
        def topologicalSortRecursive(self):
            #use stack and 
        
            # Mark all the vertices as not visited
            visited = set()
        
            stack =[]
    
            # Call the recursive helper function to store Topological
            # Sort starting from all vertices one by one
            for v in self.vertices:                # for a graph which is not only one connected component
                if v not in visited:
                    self.topologicalSortHelper(v,visited,stack)
    
            # Print contents of stack
            print("Topological sorting of the graph:", end=" ")
            while stack:
               print(stack.pop(), end=" ")

    g= Graph()
    g.addEdge(7, 2);
    g.addEdge(7, 0);
    g.addEdge(4, 0);
    g.addEdge(4, 1);
    g.addEdge(2, 3);
    g.addEdge(3, 1);       

    print ("Following is a Topological Sort of the given graph")
    g.topologicalSort()

    g2= Graph()

    g2.addEdge(1, 2);
    g2.addEdge(2, 1);
    g2.topologicalSort()

 #### 2) use iterative way;  use queue

        def addEdge(self,u,v):
            self.graph[u].append(v)
            self.vertices.add(u)

            if cnt != len(self.vertices):

##  Example 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1. Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1] Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses? The detailed description is [<span style="color:blue;"> here </span>](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)



    # Except from DFS, here we could use topological sort BFS get the indegree, get each node's indegree, then use topological sort from a node with indegree == 0
    # if we can not visit all the node, there exists a cycle in the graph
